# what is cloud computing
cloud computing id the delivery of computing of computing services - including server, storage , database ,networking , software , analytics , and intelligence over the internet.
### Benfits of cloud 
- Cost saving
- Better collaboration
- scalibility and flexibility
- advance security
### Disadvantage of cloud 
- risk of vendor lock in
- less control over under lying cloud infrastructure
- concern about data security and online threats
#### Public cloud and private cloud
Public cloud available for everyone but private cloud is available for only selected users 
#### Hybrid cloud 
it is combination of public and hybrid cloud 
### Cloud service model
- IaaS(Infrastructure as a service )
- PaaS (Platform as a service )
- SaaS(software as a service )
# Amazon Web Service 
AWS is the world most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform offering over 200 fully featured services from data centers  globally.
## Compute services 
- Elastic compute compute - EC2(most offering and provide rented VM.)
             Types of EC2
                 - t2.micro
                 - t2.xlarge
                 - c5d.4xlarge
                 - r5.16xlarge
                 - m5.8xlarge
- ECS/EKS - Containerized services
- Lambda - Serverless
## Storage services 
###### simple storage service-S3
             it is a object storage with durability of 99.99999999% which can keep the files in buckets.This is a infinitely scaling storage.It has user based security.
###### elastic block storage-EBS
###### elastic file system-EFS
###### archival service - Glacier
## Network services
- virtual private cloud - VPC
- domain name service - Route 53
- direct connect

#### Some important points 
- security groups
- vpc
- subnet
- target group
- load balancer
- key pair
- putty
- nginx
- ip address

##### summary 
   First you have to create a instance and after that you have to create a  key that will used to encrypt data and a private key that is used to decrypt data. For more information about key pairs, ensure you are signed into the AWS console and then review Amazon EC2 Key Pairs in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances. After successfull creating the instance you have to deploy application on the nginx server . For that you have to connect your instance to your SSH client like putty .
   Then you have to create load balancer and make another paired instance and divide the load equally with the help of load balancer.
